## Description 


Connecting with friends is easier to do with social networks! Users can add friends, share their thoughts, and even have their friends react to those thoughts. 

All of this is done using MongoDb , Mongoose ODM, and Express.js. I began by creating the User, Thought, and Reaction models using the required information from the project description. From there, the routes and controllers were coded. 

Since there was no seeded data, I began creating user, their thoughts, friend list, and reactions using Insomnia based on the routes that I created.

## Portfolio Example

Since this project required the use of Mongoose instead of Sequelize, I needed to reference the documentation for how proper validation syntax with Mongoose. While the concepts were the same, the were sligt differences between Mongoose and Sequelize. For example, uses the syntax "allowNull: false," to indicate that a field must have content, whereas Mongoose uses the syntax "required: true". Additionally, Sequelize utilizes DataTypes, while Mongoose does not.


Sequelize

```
 username: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },

```

Mongoose

```
  username: {
      type: String,
      unique: true,
      required: true,
      trim: true,
    },

```


## Usage 

Use Insomnia to view and interact with information using the routes.


## Learning Points 

This was my firest experience with MongoDB and Mongoose for creating a social network. I found the syntax for creating controllers and routes to be simpler and easier to navigate through than Sequelize. It is also more readable.
